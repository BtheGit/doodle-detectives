	<h2>Rules</h2>
	<p>Doodle Detectives is a game about faking it until you make it!

	Every round, players are given a secret word that they are supposed to draw a portion of during their turn. Except one player doesn't know the secret and is faking! 

	At the end of the drawing phase, players will vote on which player they think was the fake. 

	The object of the game for most players is to determine which player is the fake based on their drawing. The fake just wants to remain undiscovered (receiving less than half the votes).

	If the fake is discovered, he still has a chance to steal the win by correctly guessing what the secret was. 

	Remember, you want to draw just enough to let your fellow detectives know that you aren't the fake, but not enough to make it easy for the fake to guess the secret!</p>
